### Speak Friend, and Enter üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hey there! My name is Zachary Rosen (he/him/they/them). I am a lot of things, actually \*mutters in grumpy old person\* . . .  but one of the more important things to me is that I am a computational sociolinguist. And what that means to me is that my work tends to focus on a mixture of statistics and social language use.

Currently, that includes a lot of work specifically looking at group dynamics and information flow with some wonderful, supportive folks like Rick Dale at UCLA üòä. The central question is this: as people communicate and negotiate meaning in group interactions using language, how does that affect the way that ideas and concepts spread from group member to group member? How do these affects fluctuate over the course of a conversation, and why? And most importantly, what aspects of group identity and discourse affect that flow of information?

Information Theory meets consititutive models of communication, meets Communication Accommodation Theory, meets Social Identity Theory . . .  that's what I love. That's what makes me come alive as a researcher. All the ways people converge and build connections, measured in how they negotiate meaning as a social process ü§ì
